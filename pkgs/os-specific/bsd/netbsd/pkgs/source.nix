  # NetBSD ships each release's source as a handful of "sets": gzipped tars that
  # all unpack into `usr/src`. We take three of them:
  #
  #   src       everything outside `sys`, `share` and the imported GNU/X11 trees
  #   syssrc    the kernel -- `sys`, and the per-arch `conf` directories
  #   sharesrc  `share`, which carries `share/mk`, i.e. the build system itself
  #
  # `gnusrc` (the imported gcc/binutils) and `xsrc` (X11) are deliberately left
  # out. Nothing in this package set builds either, and together they are a
  # further ~450MB of download.
  #
  # These hashes are transcribed from the `SHA512` file NetBSD publishes beside
  # the sets, so the pin is to upstream's own checksums rather than to a digest
  # we generated ourselves.
